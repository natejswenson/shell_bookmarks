This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Shell-based bookmark manager for opening websites via terminal. Users navigate bookmarks using interactive select menus and open URLs in their default browser.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **nav.sh**: Main entry point and navigation logic
  - Reads and parses sites.csv to build hierarchical bookmark structure
  - Handles two-level navigation: top-level sites and folder-based subsites
  - Uses bash `select` for interactive menu navigation
  - Opens URLs via `xdg-open`

- **sites.csv**: Data store for all bookmarks
  - Format varies by entry type:
    - Top-level sites: `site_name,site_url`
    - Folders: `üìÅ(folder_name),folder`
    - Sites in folders: `,üìÅ(folder_name),site_name,site_url`
  - New entries are prepended (added at top) or appended based on operation

- **help.sh**: Help menu that provides options to navigate, add favorites, or edit sites.csv

- **.config**: Configuration variables for colors, prompts, and UI text using `tput`

### Key Functions (nav.sh)

- `selected_main_site()`: Gets site name from row number
- `subsites_of_selected_main_site()`: Extracts subsites for a given folder
- `folders()`: Lists all bookmark folders (entries where column 2 == "folder")
- `selected_subsite_url()`: Gets URL for a subsite by folder and selection
- `nav()`: Main navigation flow with two-level select menus
- `fav()`: Add bookmarks workflow (top-level, folder, or to-folder)

### Data Flow

1. User runs `nav` or `nav.sh`
2. Script sources .config for styling variables
3. Parses sites.csv to build menu options
4. User navigates via select menus (folder ‚Üí site or direct site)
5. Selected URL opens in browser via `xdg-open`

## Development Commands

### Testing
```bash
./run_tests.sh                    # Run all unit and integration tests
./run_tests.sh test_nav_functions # Run specific test suite
./run_tests.sh test_integration   # Run integration tests
./run_tests.sh test_help          # Run help.sh tests
```

**Test Structure:**
- `tests/test_utils.sh` - Assertion framework and test utilities
- `tests/test_nav_functions.sh` - Unit tests for nav.sh parsing functions
- `tests/test_integration.sh` - Integration tests for full workflow
- `tests/test_help.sh` - Tests for help.sh functionality

Tests automatically create temporary environments and clean up after themselves.

### Running
```bash
./nav.sh          # Open navigation menu
./nav.sh -fav     # Add a favorite
./nav.sh -h       # Show help
```

### Editing Data
```bash
vi sites.csv      # Direct edit of bookmarks (also accessible via help menu)
```

## Performance Optimizations

- **Memory-cached CSV parsing**: sites.csv is read once into `CSV_LINES` array at startup
- **Eliminated subprocess spawning**: Replaced multiple awk/cut/sed pipelines with native bash loops
- **Pre-computed main sites list**: Built during initialization rather than on-demand
- This approach is significantly faster, especially with larger bookmark files

## Important Notes

- The script uses `xdg-open` which is Linux-specific for opening URLs
- Folder entries are prefixed with üìÅ emoji for visual identification
- CSV parsing now uses in-memory arrays instead of repeated awk/cut/sed calls
- Color configuration uses tput commands (pcolor, scolor, boldcolor, etc.)
- All paths use `$my_dir` variable for portability (no hardcoded paths)
- Scripts include error handling for missing files and invalid input
